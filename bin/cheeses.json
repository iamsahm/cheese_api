  "description": "Zamorano DOP (PDO) is a renowned Spanish cheese made from raw sheep's milk in the picturesque region of Castile-Leon, Zamora. This hard cheese takes almost six months to reach its full potential. Its appearance boasts a pale-yellow hue and a delightful crumbly texture. Notably, Zamorano's distinctive zigzag pattern on its rind and cylindrical shape resembles other cheeses like Castellano or Manchego.It gets a characteristic flavour because of the milk of scruffy Churra and the Castilian sheep breed. This sweet, nutty and salty cheese is served as a table cheese with White, Red, and Zinfandel wine. ",

  "description": "Wabash Cannonball is a mould-ripened, semi-soft goat's cheese made by Judy Schad and her husband Larry at Capriole Farmstead Goat Cheeses in Indiana.Taking its name from the famous folk song of southern Indiana, Wabash Cannonball is dusted with ash and left to mature for about three to five weeks. When it is young, the chevre is thin-skinned, white, and slightly wrinkled, but as it starts to ripen, the Geotrichum and Candidum rind becomes more wrinkled allowing the ash to shine through. The pate becomes denser and finally, at three to five weeks, the cheese is drier and crumbly. Though, it can be enjoyed in all its stages.Wabash Cannonball is a dense sphere with a gentle, creamy, slightly acidic flavour with clean citrusy hints. The rind is a fluffy mushroomy snowball-like covering of Penicillium Candidum mould which gives way to a deeply wrinkled surface of Geotrichum Candidum as it matures. At its optimum age, the cheese is musky, slightly sweet with a more delicate flavour.Cannonball is best on a cheeseboard, served with dry white wines such as Sauvignon Blanc or Gruner Veltliner. It has been Best-of-Show, American Cheese Society 1995.",

It has a natural, crusty, brownish rind with patches of red, orange and yellow. The rind is marked with tiny craters.The cheese has a firm, dense, rich and creamy texture. The taste resembles burnt caramel, and there is a distinctive lanolin aroma. The ageing process of the cheese ranges from four to ten months. The younger wheels are made in December, while the older ones are in July. Both types of cheese wheels are sent to the market in April.",

Grana Padano, made in Northern Italy around the Po Valley, is an Italian cow's milk cheese. Controlled by the Grana Padana Consorzio Zanetti, the cheese is aged for a minimum of 18 months and carries a mark on the wheel. It is easily recognized because of the enormous wheels, usually ranging from 70 to 88 pounds. This is a special four-leaf clover and indicates the province of origin.Look for the Zanetti mark to ensure you are buying the best. Grana Padano could be called the bodybuilder since it is low in fat and very high in protein and calcium. It is easily digested because, during the maturation process, the proteins are broken down into amino acids. ",

  "description": "Wensleydale is an historic fresh, mild cheese that has been made in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire since 1150 by Cistercian monks. These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep’s milk was used, but over the time cow’s milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer’s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow’s milk with sheep’s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wenslydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire.Oak Smoked Wensleydale is naturally smoked for 18 hours using oak chips at the Wensleydale Creamery dairy to generate a subtle, smoked flavour along with a firmer and stronger texture. The cheese is a variant of Real Yorkshire Wensleydale as it maintains the same characteristics while adopting an attractive golden beech colour.Wensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of cheeseboard where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavours rule the roost. It complements fruity white wine such as Pinot Grigio.",

Many times Jarlsberg is marketed as a Swiss cheese because of its characteristics, though it tends to be sweeter and stronger than Emmentaler.Beneath the yellow-wax rind of Jarlsberg is a semi-firm yellow interior that is buttery, rich in texture, with a mild, nutty flavour. It is an all-purpose cheese, good for cooking as well as eating as a snack. Jarlsberg tastes delicious with sandwiches, fondues, quiches and on hot dishes. The versatility of the cheese is appreciated well beyond the Scandinavian world in the US, UK and Europe.Jarlsberg is available in wheels, slices, wedges, minis, and random-weight pieces.  ",

  "description": "Danbo (also known as \"King Christian\"), produced by Mammen Mejeri, is a matured, semi-soft, aged Danish cheese made from cow's milk. A smear-ripened and washed-rind cheese is one of Denmark’s most popular cheeses. The colour of the cheese is ivory to light yellow with a soft and slightly springy texture. The elasticity and firmness of the cheese allow for easy cutting. It has small, round eyes about 10mm in diameter that may be less prominent in variants where flavourings are used.The smell of Danbo is mild, slightly acidic, and aromatic due to smear ripening. Its unique taste and texture are achieved after maturing for about 3-4 weeks. The fat percent in Danbo varies from 15 to 45%. It is a rectangular cheese with a smooth, dry rind, and sometimes it is covered in red wax. Flavourings such as caraway seeds add a new dimension to the taste of Danbo. When caraway seeds are added to the cheese, it is known as \"King Christian\" cheese, named after King Christian IX, who ruled Denmark during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.",

The cheese becomes almost liquid after maturation. It has a greyish-yellow blanched rind which has to be removed before eating it. This rare and luxury cheese is eaten like a Fondue. Vacherin is produced only from 15th August to 31st March. The cheese tastes delicious with wines such as Beaujolais Nouveau, Côtes du Jura and Champagne. It comes in various shapes enclosed with a strip of spruce bark.",

  "description": "One of the most known Swiss cheeses, Emmentaler cheese is famous for its open texture or 'eyes'. However, Kaltbach Emmentaler AOP is more than just the characteristic holes. It is about the hallmark black-brown rind that develops as the cheese matures for 3 months in the cheese dairy and for more than 300 days in the sandstone caves of Kaltbach. During this maturation process, white crystals and drops of water are formed from the cheese, known as \"tears of joy\". These \"tears of joy\" are a sign of quality in the cheese. The cave maturation results in a tangly nutty flavour and crumbly texture, typical of the fine Swiss classic from the caves. This genuine classic cheese tastes delicious with dried apricots, dried fruits, caramelized onions and cornichons. Melt it on potatoes au gratin and flatbread. Try pairing the cheese with Oaked Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Gin.Kaltbach Emmentaler has won many international awards including bronze and gold at the World Cheese Awards.",

Cheese produced only in the provinces of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, and Bologna to the west of the Reno River and Mantua to the east of the Po River is assigned the D.O.P tag.With its rich, nutty taste and distinctive aroma, it is used by the finest chefs in food preparation. But it is equally delicious to eat with fruits, crackers and wine or sprinkled on pasta, rice or soup.The traditional production follows an 800-year old tradition of not using additives and feeding the cows on a special diet containing no silage. Parmigiano Reggiano, an Italian cow's milk cheese, would be easily recognized for another reason - the wheel is enormous, approx. 75 pounds. Controlled by Consorzio Parmigiano-Reggiano, a quasi-governmental/trade group, the cheese is aged, a minimum of 18-months to 3 years. It carries a mark on the cheese. Look for the Zanetti mark to ensure you are buying the best. The traditional flavour profile is described as nutty, and the long ageing produces white calcium spots, giving the cheese a crunchy bite.Parmigiano Reggiano is used in cooking in various ways. Grate, shred or shave it on pasta, salads, vegetables or fruits. The cheese is high in calcium, and low in fat and hence very healthy.Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is available in two ripening stages.If ripened for 18 months, the taste is sharp and nutty.If ripened for 2 - 3 years, the taste is pure, sharp and nutty.",

  "description": "Quark (or quarg) is a traditional, creamy, vegetarian, fresh dairy product tracing its origin to German-speaking and Eastern European countries. It is known by many names, chief among them being творог in Russian, tvaroh in Czech and Slovak, topfen in Austria, kwark in Dutch, kvark in Denmark and kvarg in Norway and Sweden. Quark is said to be a cross between yoghurt and cottage cheese.This fresh, soft, white curd cheese is prepared from pasteurised cow's milk with a small amount of rennet added to achieve a good, firm curd. However, traditional quark is a purely fresh dairy product and does not make use of rennet.It is moist, snowy white in colour with a subtle taste and smooth & soft texture. Its texture is similar to that of cream cheese, pot cheese or ricotta, with a fat content ranging from low to medium. Quark is usually sold in plastic tubs with most or all of the whey. The flavour is reminiscent of sour cream with the seasonings of herbs, spices or fruits. The quark makes a great base for many recipes, such as cheesecake, pasta, creamy sauces, sandwiches, salads and desserts. It pairs well with Champagne, White sparkling, Pacherenc-du-vic-bilh White, Coteaux-du-layon White, Monbazillac White and Cadillac White.Quark is also produced outside their respective native countries, such as in Australia and the United States.",

  "description": "Vacherin Fribourgeois AOC is a Swiss semi-soft cheese made with raw cow’s milk in the towns of Bulle (Canton Vaud) and Fribourg (Canton Fribourg in west-central Switzerland). This cheese is also made in other parts of Switzerland including the Jura Mountains on the border of France.The milk for the cheese is sourced from Fribourgeois breed of cows that graze on the Alpine grass and wildflowers all the way through the late spring and summer. As early fall arrives, the cows are brought down to graze on grass and summer hay. No other fodder is given to the cows except the Alpine meadows.This traditional cheese making process ensures that Vacherin Fribourgeois has a pleasant nutty flavour underpinned by notes of fresh hay and milk. Vacherin has an unpalatable natural and brushed washed rind with a stinky aroma, but it does not overpower the lovely smell of the cheese. The interior of the cheese is straw coloured with an open and buttery texture.Today Vacherin Fribourgeois is produced only by a small number of artisanal cheese makers and hence is very difficult to find. It has a Swiss AOC status with 6 varieties available: Classic (aged 6-12 weeks), Extra (aged minimum 12 weeks), Rustic (aged minimum 12 weeks, but up to 25 weeks (6 months)), Alpage (aged 12–25 weeks), Mountain (aged 9–25 weeks) and Organic (aged minimum 9 weeks).Vacherin Fribourgeois is used in fondues, cooking and as a table cheese. It is a great melting cheese, so try it on grilled sandwiches, potatoes or over steamed vegetables. Big and bold Burgundy’s, Bordeaux or reds from the Rhone Valley in France will complement the cheese well.",

  "description": "Oaxaca, also known as Queso Oaxaca, Asadero or Quesillo is a Mexican name for a semi-soft, white, string-type, Hispanic-style cheese made from cow's milk. Belonging to the pasta filata family, similar to a Mozzarella, Oaxaca is a stretched curd cheese, kneaded and sold in long ropes gently wound in balls.One of the artisanal cheeses, Oaxaca has savory mellow buttery flavour and is a great melting cheese. The little salty and mild flavour make it is one of the most popular cheeses for preparing quesadillas. In addition, Oaxaca is an excellent stuffing cheese in baking recipes. In both texture and flavour, it can be compared to a young Monterey Jack cheese. Although the cheese lacks a strong flavour, its mild taste is a favorite with kids.",

  "description": "Ragusano is an Italian PDO-protected cheese made exclusively in the provinces of Ragusa and Siracusa, Sicily. It is one of the oldest cheeses in Sicily, with evidence dating as early as 1500. Initially known by the name of Caciocavallo, it lost its historical name after acquiring the recognition of PDO. A hard cheese from the pasta filata family, Ragusano is made with whole milk from the Modicana breed of cows fed on fresh grass or hay. When milk from other cow breeds is used, due to the scarcity of the Modicana breed, the cheese is called “Cosacavaddu Rausanu”.The cheese is sold at different stages of ageing in rectangular blocks. When it is fresh within two months of production, the cheese tastes sweet, pleasant and delicate. Cheeses ripened beyond six months tend to become more flavourful and spicier. The rind is smooth and thin and exhibits a yellowish-golden colour that deepens as the cheese ages. Ragusano, smoked using natural processes, is also available, and here, the designation stamp will have the word “affumicato” attached to the name of the cheese. A compact cheese with straw-coloured pate, Ragusano goes well with full-bodied red wines and aged dark beers.",

As it ripens, there is intense sharpness on the palate and the texture evolves to a velvety runny consistency. The cheese tastes delicious when served with tomato and basil pasta.The cheese has won many awards including gold medal at 2010 Royal Queensland Food & Wine Show, 2012 Royal Queensland Food and Wine Show, 2012 Brisbane Cheese Awards and many more.",

  "description": "Quartirolo Lombardo is a soft cow's milk cheese with PDO status. Its history dates back to the 10th century, produced seasonally using milk from cows grazing on \"erba quartirola\". Today, it's made year-round and recognized by the EU as a DOP product.It originates from areas including Bergamo, Milan, and Pavia in Italy. The cheese has a rectangular shape, a thin and delicate rind that changes colour from pinkish-white to reddish-grey and green hues with age. Internally, the cheese's texture is cohesive and delicately granular, occasionally presenting small detachments that lend it a slightly crumbly nature. Over time, as ageing progresses, its consistency transforms, becoming both denser and softer. Also, the flavour changes from mildly acidic to more aromatic with age.",

This is an unusual treat as blue cheeses are generally not made in this area.It is a semi-hard cheese with uniform blue veins and a dense, mellow-flavoured interior. The natural rind is somewhat dry when the cheese is young, but with age it becomes moist, resulting in an extra tangy richness.  Cheese made in spring is light in taste and texture whilst those from the coming winter season have more strong, intense flavours and heavier texture. The range of flavour varies from sweet butter to lemon zest and peppery. Accompany the cheese with Juracon Moelleux or Port.",

It is one of the popular cheeses from Spain and comes under the PDO (DOP) guidelines. The Corcuera Family was the first in all of Castilla La Mancha to make and commercialize Manchego Cheese. They produce the cheese in Toledo province.The traditional use of grass moulds leaves a distinctive, characteristic flavour and leaves an aftertaste that is because of sheep's milk. Authentic Manchego is only made from the Manchego sheep's milk. Manchego cheese is made from both pasteurised and unpasteurised milk. The farmhouse version is produced from unpasteurised milk while the industrial version is produced from pasteurised milk. Manchego has a firm and compact consistency and a buttery texture, with unevenly distributed air pockets. The colour varies from white to ivory-yellow, and the inedible rind from yellow to brownish-beige.El Trigal® brand Manchego cheese is available in many varieties depending on its age, and milk used.Manchego El Trigal® DOP 6 mo. - is extremely buttery and aged to perfection.Manchego El Trigal® DOP 8 mo.

  "description": "Kanterkaas (also known as Friesian) is a PDO-awarded Dutch cheese traditionally made only in the province of Friesland and Westerkwartier. Dutch cheeses similar to Kanterkaas but without the PDO label are known as Friese nagelkaas or simply nagelkaas. Kanter is the Dutch word for 'edge', referring to the angular shape of the cheese, with a sharp transition from the side to the bottom of the cheese.Kanterkaas is available in two varieties: Kanterkomijnekaas, flavoured with cumin, and Kanternagelkaas, laced with cumin and cloves. It is a hard cheese made with two types of fats: 20+ (20-25%) and 40+ (40-44%). The colour of the rind is natural or may be treated with a colourless, yellow-coloured, or red-coloured cheese rind coating agent.The flavour of Kanterkaas changes as it ages. Plain Kanterkaas is nice and spicy to tangy, depending on age. Kanterkomijnekaas tastes fragrant, spicy, pleasant and mild to intense.Kanternagelkaas flavour varies from fragrant, spicy, warm and spicy to tangy. The pate of the cheese is firm to hard. The colour of Kanter cheese is evenly ivory or yellow to yellow-green. It has a closed body, but some holes may exist. The cloves and cumin are evenly spread throughout the pate.",

  "description": "Valençay cheese is one of the classic French cheeses made in the province of Berry and Tourraine in France. It is named after the town of Valençay in the Indre department, France. Valençay is an unpasteurised goats-milk cheese. Its rind has a rustic blue-grey colour which is made of natural moulds. The rind is darkened by dusting charcoal powder. It is usually available between March and December. The cheese achieved AOC status in 1998, making Valençay the first region to achieve AOC status.Valençay cheese used to have a perfect pyramid shape with a pointed top. But when Napoleon returned to the castle of Valencay after his unsuccessful expedition in Egypt, he saw the cheese, in a fit of rage, drew his sword and cut off the top of the cheese. Since then, the cheese has always been made with a flattened top. ",

  "description": "Idiazabal (also known as Idiazabel / Queso Idiazabal La Vasco Navarra) is a traditional, farmhouse, hard cheese made from raw milk of Latxa or Carranza sheep in the Basque and Navarra regions of northern Spain. Named after the village of Idiazabal, the cheese received Spanish D.O. (Denominacion de Origen) in 1987.In summer, the sheep migrate to higher pastures to graze on the blossoming, new grass. During this time, the artisanal cheese makers milk the sheep, make the cheese and leave it in the rafters to mature for a minimum of two months. Matured Idiazabal has a hard natural rind, a compact texture, with a few pinprick holes. The rind carries the marks of the wooden moulds in which it was drained. The characteristic, smoky flavour is the result of the cheeses having been stored near the fireplaces. The taste of the cheese is reminiscent of burnt caramel and bacon. The pairs well with red wine and cider.PDO Idiazabal smoked cheese won a Super Gold medal at the 2014 World Cheese Awards. It is declared one of the world's 62 best cheeses. ",

Now-a-days, many stores sell goat and cow’s milk feta as well.Odysseus Feta is carefully ripened in small old wooden barrels using traditional methods. During three months months of aging, the salted curds ferment under whey and develops a yeasty aroma. When aged completely the cheese develops soft milky texture and creamy peppery finish.Odysseus Marinated Feta:After removing Odysseus Feta from the barrels, it is marinated in 100% Greek extra virgin olive oil and rolled in dried Greek oregano and rosemary, that gives it a hint of herbs.",

Like many other Norwegian products, such as flatbread and stockfish, Gammelost can be stored for a long duration without refrigeration.A firm, blue-veined Gammelost cheese imparts a sharp and aromatic flavour. Ripened using Mucor, Rhizopus, and Penicillium moulds, the semi-soft crust of the cheese is brownish while the pate is brownish-yellow with a hue of blue and green. Texturally, the cheese is firm, dense, moist and usually granular. It is rich in protein with a low-fat content of 0.5 to 1.0%.Every year, a Gamalost festival (Gamalostfestivalen) is held in Vik in Sogn at the advent of summer.",

To prevent the cheese from mould infestation, it is washed with seawater once a week. The maturation takes 6 to 10 weeks to form a thin crust.These days the cheese is made from pasteurised and unpasteurised milk in factories. These factory-made cheeses have brighter and moderate flavours.Taleggio has been granted a PDO designation and contains 48% fat. The cheese has a strong smell, but the taste is relatively mild, with an unusual fruity tang. Taleggio can be served grated on salads. Since it melts well, it can be used in risotto or polenta.",

Cooking the Halloumi removes all its saltiness and empowers it with a creamy texture. Since the cheese has a high melting point, it can be easily fried or grilled. Its unusualness lies in the Halloumi is an essential part of a Cyprus Meze, and many times it is offered as an accompaniment with a cold beer.

Like an Old Kentucky Tomme, it is a buttery and smooth but nuttier and firmer like a Tomme du Savoie whilst sporting a mushroomy natural rind of herbs like a Brin d'Amor. The paste of Julianna is white and slightly shiny. It softens and becomes more translucent with age.  Flavours are buttery, mildly tangy and nutty enhanced by the presence of herbs. ",

Its hard, natural rind has a distinctive sienna colour acquired during the smoking process. Gamonéu is semi-hard, smoked and friable cheese with small, irregular eyes scattered throughout the pate.

  "description": "Juustoleipä (cheese bread), also known as leipäjuusto (bread cheese) or juusto, originally comes from Southern Ostrobothnia, Northern Finland and Kainuu. It is known in English as 'Finnish squeaky cheese'. Other dialects have various names, such as narskujuusto that depict the way that fresh leipäjuusto \"squeaks\" against the teeth when bitten. Among all its synonyms, leipäjuusto is the more commonly known name.Leipäjuusto is a fresh cheese made from cow's beestings, rich milk from a cow that has recently calved. It can also be made from reindeer or goat milk. The cheese is 'toasted' during its preparation. It contains about 20 to 22% fat, while lighter versions contain about 12% fat.Traditionally, people used to let leipäjuusto get totally dried so that they could store it for several years. For eating, they used to heat the almost rock-hard leipäjuusto cheese on fire to soften it and produce an appetizing aroma. Even today, the cheese is dried by keeping it in a well-ventilated area for a few days. But, unlike its older version, it has a mild flavour.",

The procedure for making the cheese is similar to Indian paneer, which includes boiling whole fresh milk, adding an acidifying agent to form the curds and then draining the curds in a cheesecloth.The texture and flavour of Queso Blanco is mild, firm and crumbly. It softens without melting, a characteristic very important in Latin American cooking. One can crumble Queso Blanco on salads, over rice and beans or serve it as a table cheese with fresh fruit, marmalade or chutney.",

This deep golden cheese has been made in mountain chalets near France and Switzerland for centuries. It is made exclusively from unpasteurised milk produced by the Abondance breed of cattle. Since 1990, the cheese has been enjoying the prestigious AOC designation. The handcrafted, wheel-shaped cheese is made using traditional methods only in the geographical area specified by the AOC/PDO label.It has a strong smell and an intensely fruity, buttery and hazelnut flavour, with the balance of acidity and sweetness, followed by a lingering aftertaste. Unearth an aroma of nutty vegetation as you slice the cheese. However, remember the crust, including the grey layer beneath, should be removed before eating. Firm but supple and slightly grainy, the texture of the ivory-yellow pâté is creamy and velvety. Its rind is smooth with an amber colour showing canvas marks. The affinage takes at least 100 days that help release the subtle aromas.Abondance can be eaten straight off, added to salads or melted in Berthoud. It pairs well with Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon.",

The full-bodied cheese is rich in flavour with a soft paste and a moist, creamy, yet almost flaky, texture. It is covered by a velvety grey mould coating that lends it a woody aroma. The flavour is reminiscent of damp earth underlined by slightly nutty & herbal essences. Its milky, delicate taste is not at all typical of a goat’s cheese. Garrotxa pairs well with crusty country bread, nuts and is best served with white wines such as a Catalonian Priorat, Pinot Gris, Verdejo, or Chardonnay.",

  "description": "Reblochon AOC is a semi-soft, washed-rind and smear-ripened mountain cheese that originated at the heart of the massif des Aravis, in the Thônes region of Haute-Savoie in France. The cheese was decreed as an AOC cheese in 1958 and therefore is subject to follow strict rules and regulations. It is a lightly pressed, uncooked cheese made from full-cream unpasteurised milk. Thirteenth-century fables tell of Savoie herdsmen who carried out an incomplete milking of the cows to reduce their 'taxable' production of milk. After the rent was paid to the landowners, they went back to 'remilk' (reblocher) the cows. The second milking of cows yielded milk that was rich in fat, and was used to make Reblochon.Reblochon features a fine, velvety rind, varying from yellow to orange. The close textured pate is very smooth, supple and ivory in colour. Farmhouse cheese discs are matured for at least two weeks, during which the cheese develops an edible light beige crust and buttery dough. Reblochon has a slight scent of the cellar and a mild fruity taste with an intense nutty aftertaste. Its delicate and subtle flavours go well with a glass of Savoie wine. The cheese is excellent on the cheeseboard. Reblochon also features as a classic ingredient in one of the Alps' best-loved dishes, the Tartiflette.",

  "description": "Kashkaval is a semi-hard, yellow cheese that derives its name from the Italian cheese \"Caciocavallo\". It is particularly popular in Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean region.Kashkaval made from cow's milk is known as Kashkaval Vitosha while a cheese made from ewe's milk is called Kashkaval Balkan. Kashkaval Preslav is the name given to the cheese made from a mixture of ewe's and cow's milk. In Romania, Bulgaria, and Macedonia, Kashkaval used as a generic term for all kinds of yellow cheeses. This cheese is also found in Hungary, Croatia, and Turkey. The Romanians call this cheese Cascaval, the Greeks Kasseri, while the Turkish prefer to interpret it as Ksara.The cheese is allowed to age for six months, during which it develops a piquant, spicy and somewhat salty taste with a slight hint of olive oil. Due to its similarity in taste with the United Kingdom's Cheddar cheese, it is famously called the \"Cheddar cheese of the Balkans\". Kashkaval belongs to the family of pasta filata cheese that is made by giving the curd a hot bath during the production process.The slightly hard texture of this table cheese makes it suitable for grilling and grating. It is used in salads, appetizers, pizzas, and lasagna.",

A legend tells that French farm girls fell in love with English soldiers during the Hundred Years War and started making heart-shaped cheese to show their love.Granted AOC status in 1969, Neufchatel can be industrial, farmstead or artisanal. Artisanal Neufchatel has a grainy, close texture and thick paste covered with a soft, downy, velvety bloomy rind. Matured for 8–10 weeks, the becomes sharper and saltier. It looks similar to Camembert and Brie.",

  "description": "Feta is undoubtedly one of the most famous Greek cheeses. feta occupies 70% stake in Greek cheese consumption. The cheese is protected by EU legislation, and only those cheeses manufactured in Macedonia, Thrace, Thessaly, Central Mainland Greece, the Peloponnese, Lesvos and the Island of Kefalonia can be called ‘feta’. Similar cheeses produced elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean and around the Black Sea, outside the EU, are often called ‘White Cheese’.To create traditional feta, 30% goat's milk is mixed with sheep's milk of animals grazing on pastures in the specific appellation of origin regions. Nowadays, many stores sell goat's and cow's milk feta as well. The firmness, texture and flavour of the cheese differ from region to region. Still, in general, cheese from Macedonia and Thrace is mild, softer and creamier, less salty with fewer holes. Feta made in Thessaly and Central Greece has a more intense, robust flavour. Peloponnese feta is dryer in texture, fully flavoured and more open. Local environment, animal breeds, and cultures have an impact on the texture, flavour and aroma of the cheese.On the whole, feta is a pickled curd cheese that has a salty and tangy taste enhanced by the brine solution. The texture depends on the age, which can be extremely creamy or crumbly dry. Upon maturation of 2 months, feta is sold in blocks submerged in the brine. The cheese can be used as a table cheese or melted on a traditional Greek salad, spanakopita, pizza or pie. It tastes delicious with olive oil, roasted red peppers and nuts. If required, it can be washed under water to remove the extra saltiness. The salty flavour of feta pairs well with beer, Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc and Zinfandel.",

  "description": "Kasseri is a traditional Greek-Turkish cheese made from unpasteurised sheep milk with no more than 20% goat milk mixed in. It is a springy-textured, stringy cheese belonging to the pasta filata family like Provolone or Muenster. The cheese needs to be matured for a minimum of four months to obtain the correct texture and flavour. This white-crust cheese also competes against another famous Greek cheese, Feta. Kasseri is used as a substitute for mozzarella by many Americans and is preferred by connoisseurs who like full-flavoured cheeses. A bite of Kasseri will enrich your palate with exciting salty flavours and a pungent odour. But interestingly, it soon leaves behind a sweet aftertaste because of the usage of sheep milk.The fat content of this table cheese is between 25% - 45%, and it goes well with omelettes, and sandwiches.",

In Romania, Cas or Telemea cheese is reprocessed to make Urda cheese. The procedure is similar to that of making Ricotta. It is often moulded to the shape of a half-sphere. The paste is grainy, silky and pleasant to taste. In Romanian cooking, Urda is often used to make desserts such as clătită and plăcintă.",

As it ages, the cheese softens like ice-cream and has the sweet acidity and characteristic nuttiness. Affinage takes four to six weeks. Another very famous cheese by Mary Holbook is Little Rydings. This cheese is made from the same curd, but the period of maturing is different.Sleight farm, no longer makes Emlett cheese.",

It is made from unpasteurized cow's milk from their own herd of grass-fed cows living on the farm. The cheddar uses a traditional recipe passed down by preceding generations. It is pressed and bathed for three days and matured for 16 to 18 months. The resulting cheese is dense with a rich and creamy texture. It has savoury, mustardy, juicy and a sharp sting at the end. Another version called 'extra mature unpasteurised cheddar' is matured for at least an extra six months.Accompany freshly baked bread, fine wine or a good beer alongside some sweet, creamy Keens Cheddar.",

It is inspired by a small, Spanish rustic cheese Jim Schott tried in Spain. This natural rind, aged cheese with a semi-firm texture is aged for 4-12 months, during which it is allowed to develop toasted almond and earthy notes. Queso de Mano is an excellent domestic stand-in due to its textural and flavour similarities with Spanish and Italian cheeses.Grate it over eggs, pasta, or salads, or melt in sandwiches. Enjoy the cheese with Hefeweizen or light-to-full-bodied red wines.Queso de Mano has won many awards; the most notable ones were at the American Cheese Society 2003, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2013 competition.",

As the cheese strengthens at every stage of its development, the flavours and texture continue to evolve. At 6 months the smooth and creamy cheese is complemented by bright, fruity and citric flavours, but at the first year, these give way to a crunchy, crumbly and tangy cheese with a savoury, buttery, malty finish sensation.A fruity Pinot Noir, strong ale, apple liqueur or cider, or a vintage port makes a great match with Georgia Gold Clothbound Cheddar.

The cheese is widely popular across the Levant region, where it is used as a table cheese.The cheese is commonly made using pasteurized cow's milk but can be made with goat or sheep's milk. It is produced on a large scale in Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Gaza, Egypt, and Cyprus, where people typically eat it with a soft flatbread at lunch and dinner. Its texture can be compared to Mozzarella, Feta or Mizithra, as it does not melt very well. The resistance to melting makes it an excellent frying cheese. The cheese can be stored for up to a year.",

It is a hard, light-yellow cheese with a sharp flavour and dry texture. The colour varies from yellow to white depending upon the mixture of milk used. Young cheeses are aged for a minimum of two to three months, whereas aged Kefalotyri can be a year old or more with a dry, stronger flavour.Kefalotyri tastes similar to Gruyere; however, it is harder and saltier. The cheese is consumed as is or used in pasta, meat and cooked vegetable dishes. It is also traditionally served fried in strips or cubes for a dish called saganaki. Ideal for cheeseboards, the tangy cheese is served with fresh seasonal fruit, such as pears, figs and grapes, alongside red wine and sausages.  ",

  "description": "Australia boasts one of the world’s leading dairy industries. Various dairy products are produced here because of the clean, lush pastures and diverse climate. With access to technology from England in the 1850s, Australia made more than 160 cheeses.Washed rind cheeses are originally from the alleys of northern France, made famous by the monks who invented them. It was a deliberate attempt to develop a meaty flavour in the cheese as people have to abstain from meat for a long period. Washed rind cheeses are periodically washed in a solution of saltwater brine, wines and/or mould-bearing agents so that their surface becomes responsive to bacteria. This bacterium (Brevibacterium Linens) “smears” the cheese with a firm, palatable, bright red/orange rind and imparts pungent odours and distinctive flavours to the product. Also known as surface-ripened, the cheeses can be soft, semi-hard, or hard. Some common examples are Titlist, Gruyere and Raclette, and their rinds are washed during the maturation process to develop a crusty shell. These rich cheeses have a robust aroma with a sweet, earthy and little nutty flavour.",

It has woodsy and sweet with lemony, mustardy, and vegetal flavours. The cheese is held together by the bark, which can be peeled off when it is a bit younger. However, the bark should be kept as is with loosened cheese, and the portions should be spooned out separately.Oaked white wine or barrel-aged sour beers go well with the cheese. Also, don't forget some fruit mostarda and crusty bread. ",

It is produced only by the Norrmejerier Swedish dairy company at their Burträsk farm. The Swedes salute it as the “Emperor of cheeses”.Västerbottensost is a hard, granular cheese with a distinct character and powerful aromatic aroma. The taste is similar to Parmesan cheese, salty but with sweeter notes. Also, the texture is crumblier than an Italian Parmigianino Reggiano. It is a slow-maturing cheese with a minimum of a one-year ripening period. Light yellow in colour, Västerbottensost is a full-fat cheese containing 31% fat. Since the production is limited, it is twice as expensive as other aged cheeses. It is usually produced in the shape of a wheel, with smooth, yellow waxed rind.Swedish enjoy this cheese at August crayfish parties, and it is a must ingredient in the highly popular Västerbotten cheese pie.",

When launched in 1995, Yorkshire Blue was Shepherds Purse’s first blue and first cow’s milk cheese.Handcrafted, the cheese is matured over a period of 8 weeks during which the cheese is turned one at a time to ensure uniform blue veining and creaminess.  Upon ripening, the cheese is buttery, sweet and mild in flavour. Extended ageing will give the Yorkshire Blue a more pronounced flavour, but it will always remain mild & creamy. This moist and spreadable cheese can be crumbled or melted into soups, sauces and baking dishes.",

Without the aid of refrigeration, it was best to turn any leftover milk to curd. Curd from the second day's milk was added to the first and even from the third. This is how Lancashire cheese is still made today from cow's milk.When creamy Lancashire cheese further matures, the flavour of the cheese intensifies. This cheese can be aged for up to 24 months. This cheese is then classified as Tasty Lancashire cheese. Tasty Lancashire is rich, smooth with a nutty and buttery flavour.The tasty Lancashire cheese is best had with bread, pickle, or a Real ale beer.",

The creamy Cheddar is blended with mustard seed and Welsh ale and aged for three months. The mustard seeds not only give it a unique texture but also an amazing buttery and spicy flavour. Along with the subtle sharpness of mustard seeds, the flavour of Red Dragon is also reminiscent of the mild, sharp taste of the Welsh ale and traditional cheddar.

  "description": "Gloucester is a traditional, full-fat, hard cheese made from pasteurised or unpasteurised cow milk. The cheese, made from the milk of once nearly extinct Old Gloucester cows, traces its origins to 1498 in the City of Gloucester.Gloucester comes in two varieties. Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk and Double Gloucester uses full-fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavourful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses whole milk taken from two milkings or a mixture of milk and cream. On the other hand, Single Gloucester uses whole cream milk from the morning milking and skimmed milk from the evening milking. Single Gloucester has a P.D.O designation, meaning it is produced only in Gloucestershire. It is matured for less time and thus develops a fresh, somewhat nutty taste but is slightly more acidic than Double. Also, it is lighter in texture, crumbly and low in fat.Double Gloucester has a smooth buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour due to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used, and the cheese is aged for at least four months. The cheese develops more complex and nutty flavours if it is aged further. Moreover, the texture tends to become very hard and flaky.Double Gloucester participates every year in Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake, where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. A traditional British Ale or red like Syrah perfectly complements a Double Gloucester.",

The rind of the cheese is red-orange, while the inside reveals a soft ivory pate. A 1-2 days matured cheese can sometimes be used for cooking, but essentially, 2-3 months matured Venaco makes a perfect addition to a cheese platter. An intensely mature Venaco can be used as a grating cheese on pasta and soups.The aroma of Venaco is complex, complemented by a strong, melt-in-the-mouth taste. In early May, a great place to try Corsican cheeses is at the Venaco cheese fair, A Fiera di U Casgiu. ",

  "description": "Nicasio Square is a first washed rind cheese, named after the main square of Nicasio, produced by Nicasio Valley Cheese Company in Nicasio, California. Inspired by the classic Italian Taleggio cheese, the cheese is made using 100% organic cow's milk. During ripening the cheese is washed with brine solution that gives it an orange-gold rind. The cheese has strong flavour of bacon with earthy and garlic notes. When young the cheese is mild, buttery in flavour that becomes intense as it ages.Since the cheese has a high melting point it tastes good with roasted potatoes, vegetables. It pairs well with white wines or beer.",

There are two varieties of Weichkaese: white cheese with a velvety white coating of a mould such as Brie, Camembert Suisse or Tomme and soft cheese with brown smeared rind, like Reblochon, Limburger, Muenster or Vacherin Mont-d'Or AOP.Weichkaese is a popular dessert cheese that pairs well with fruits and bread as a snack. It is also suitable for baked dishes or for browning vegetables and potatoes. If stored in a cool place, soft cheese lasts for one week.",

  "description": "The cheese is currently unavailable on producers site.Given that Affidélice au Chablis is born in Burgundy, it bears a lot of similarity to Epoisses cheese. Made from pasteurised full cream cow’s milk in spring-fall season, the cheese takes 3-4 weeks to fully mature.The highlight of the cheese is that it is regularly washed with Chablis, a local high-status white wine until the maturing process is over. This bath in wine slowly makes its impact on the yellow-orangish ferments inside the cheese. As it nears maturity, the cheese glows of a deep copper pigmentation to reveal the richness of Burgundian soils.Once the cheese is removed from the wooden box, it turns extremely creamy and velvety. The texture is dense covered by a soft, moist, orange rind. The mild, savoury flavour perfectly sets off the strong, aromatic smell of the cheese. It goes well with sweet and acidic fruits. It augments the flavour of dry white wines like Chardonnay and of course Chablis.",

The powerful but pure taste is perfectly suited to a strong, fruity white wine or red wine as well as many strong beers.",

Niolo, the soft, creamy white cheese with somewhat sticky consistency, comes in a square shape. It has a nutty flavour and a natural white/grey rind. When ripened for three months, Niolo gets its strong smell for which it is famous and known!This cheese goes well with North American cuisine and white wine.",

  "description": "Red Leicester, formerly known as Leicester or Leicestershire cheese is a traditional hard English cheese made from unpasteurised cow’s milk. The history of cheese dates back to the 17th century when farmers recognized the need to make and look at their cheeses apart from cheese made in other parts of the country. They decided that the colour of the cheese should denote its richness and creaminess. To set it apart from cheddar and highlight the quality of cheese, Leicester is coloured with a vegetable dye called annatto. The rind is reddish-orange with a powdery mould on it. The colour indicates that the milk used has a high cream content. Today, only a couple of farms in Leicestershire make the cheese using the traditional method and raw milk.Red Leicester is a hard cheese, similar to cheddar but much moister, crumblier with a milder flavour. It matures faster than cheddar and can be sold as young as two months. A good Leicester cheese can be identified by a firm body and a close, flaky texture. Though the cheese can be consumed young, to reach its optimum flavour, it should be allowed to mature for six to nine months. A good cheese tastes slightly sweet with an almost caramel flavour and builds up a more robust taste as it ages. The cheese suits a full-bodied white wine such as Muscadet, SancerreChenin Blanc and Vouvray.",

It is made by curdling in a mould at a temperature of between 20° and 25°C (68° and 77°F), for 10 to 48 hours. During its preparation, animal rennet is added. The cheese comes in different types recognised by its shape, added ingredients, and the ageing period.The cheese is also available in three varieties, Cured, Semi-cured and Soft, depending on the ageing period.Though this cheese is produced all year round, the best type is the one made during spring and winter as the fat content of the milk is at its highest!Afuega'l Pitu is eaten either when fresh and slightly aired or once matured after several weeks in a fresh, damp, well-ventilated atmosphere.",

In addition, they ensure the cheese-making process starts in mid-April when the grasses feed the cows are better, and the milk supply is sufficient. Havilah is a dense cheese with a beautiful, earthy black rind made from a layer of ash beneath which lies a dense, yellowish pate. Slightly pungent, this mouth-watering dense cheese reveals fruity tones of pineapple, citrus, and caramel. It is perfect for grating or meting on dishes such as pasta. If Havilah is aged beyond 16 months, it begins to develop granules giving the cheese a wonderful texture.",

It takes six gallons of ewe’s milk to produce one wheel of Etorki.Cheesemaking in the Pyrenees region has been following a tradition that has remained unchanged for the last 4000 years. It requires the cheese to be pressed but not cooked and slowly matured for a period of three to six months.Etorki has a rusty, bumpy rind because of the molds formed during pressing. The smooth, supple and velvety interior is white with occasional holes or slits. It has a sweet and earthy aroma suggestive of the caramel flavours released by the pressed and aged sheep’s milk.Pair Etorki with chardonnay, riojas or traditional, sparkling white wines.",

  "description": "Yorkshire Wensleydale or simply Wensleydale, is a historic mild cheese that has been made in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire, since 1150 by Cistercian monks. These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally the cheese was made using sheep's milk. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer's wives, who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow's milk and sheep's milk to enhance flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wensleydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire.Wensleydale Creamery produces five types of Wensleydale cheese depending on the age and flavours - Real Yorkshire Wensleydale, Mature Wensleydale, Extra Mature Wensleydale, Blue Wensleydale and Oak Smoked Wensleydale.A Real Yorkshire Wensleydale is creamy-white in colour and has a supple, crumbly, moist and flaky texture. It appears similar to a young Caerphilly. The flavour is mild, clean, and slightly sweet, with hints of wild honey savour and fresh acidity. As it ages, the cheese develops a fuller, deeper flavour as well becomes firmer. Yorkshire Wensleydale cheese produced by Wensleydale Creamery is available in truckles/cylinders or block shaped in varying shapes and sizes up to 25kg.Wensleydale goes well with fruit cake and apples and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or teatime. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of a cheeseboard, where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavours rule the roost.Varieties:Oak Smoked Wensleydale is produced by naturally smoking the cheese for 18 hours using oak chips to create a subtle, smoked flavour. It is the same as Real Yorkshire Wensleydale except for the striking golden beech colour and the robust flavour imparted by the smokiness.Mature Wensleydale is a harder, flavoured variant of Wensleydale.Extra Mature Wensleydale is the strongest Wensleydale aged for nine months.Blue Wensleydale is a blue-veined cheese that has been the supreme champion winner at the British Cheese Awards 2012.Unpasteurized Wensleydale handcrafted from a single dairy herd is also available. It has a complex lemony flavour with a buttery and creamy texture.Blended Wensleydale, flavoured with delicate fruits like cranberries, apricots, pineapples, ginger, garlic and chives, is one of the favourite buys at the creamery.Wensleydale cheeses complement fruity white wine, such as Pinot Grigio.",

  "description": "Teifi is an unpasteurised cow's milk cheese from Wales. Produced by the Caws Teifi Cheese Company, this semi-hard cheese was created by John and Patrice Savage-Ontswedder.The cheese is similar to Gouda, with a deep sunshine-yellow interior. There are several varieties of Teifi, depending on the maturation period. When young, the cheese has a mellow, slightly sweet flavour and a smooth, creamy texture. As it matures, it develops deep, rich flavours with a hard and almost flaky texture, similar to Parmesan. The affinage usually takes two to nine months. Sometimes nettles, seaweeds, garlic, onion, sweet pepper and cumins are added for a distinct flavour.Available variants of Teifi cheese are: Natural Teifi Cheese, Seaweed Teifi Cheese, Onion and Garlic Teifi Cheese, Nettle Teifi Cheese, Cumin Teifi Cheese, Sweet Pepper Teifi Cheese, Oak Smoked Teifi Cheese, Mature Teifi Cheese and Chilli Teifi Cheese.The cheese melts in strings and therefore tastes excellent when heated, toasted and added as a flavouring on pizzas.",

In some cases, cow’s milk is also used. The cheese was originally produced only in Romania but when the Vlach population started spreading beyond their native country, the recipe became popular in European nations like Greece, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Poland. Sharing similarities to Feta, Telemea is used in salads and in pairings with snacks. There are a few variations with cumin seeds in it that assign the cheese a spicy aftertaste. As Telemea is stored in a brine solution, it gets saltier with age.",

  "description": "Tete de Moine AOP is a semi-hard, unpasteurized cow's milk cheese from Switzerland. It is classified as Alpine cheese or a Swiss-type chees, and was initially produced more than eight centuries ago by the monks.  It is believed that the monks staying at Moutier, the mountainous zone of the Bernese Jura in Canton of Bern, manufactured this cheese. And hence the cheese takes the name 'Tete de Moine', meaning 'Monk's Head'.It is aged for a minimum of 2½ months on a small spruce plank and is typically paired with a dry, white wine. The reddish-brown crust of the cheese is grainy, moist and lubricated and the yellow-to-ivory-coloured paste is homogeneous, sticky and supple.  To enjoy the best taste, a tool called 'Girolle' was invented in 1982. A scraper attached to the central axis of the apparatus makes scrapping the cheese easier!Tete de Moine proves to be the best companion for Crisp White Wines such as Pinot Grigio.",

The cheese, which is said to have originated during Bronze Age, was awarded DOP status in 1996.The cheese is made with milk sourced from a single flock of the local Sardinian breed as per DOP standards. After ageing for eight months, the cheese develops a natural rustic brown rind and a sour, damp smell. It is carefully smoked, adding another layer of complexity. Upon slicing, the pate reveals a compact, dense, straw yellow or white colour. It is wonderfully rich in flavour with a granular texture.  ",

The texture is sliceable when removed from the fridge and spreadable if allowed to warm at room temperature. Vegetarians can confidently consume this cheese.Since, the cheese is made from ewe's milk; it has a sweet flavour and aroma with a high percentage of acid. The period of ripening is from 10 - 22 days and the content of fat is about 45 per cent. A Judy Bell invention, Olde York has won many prizes including \"100% Sheeps Milk\" - Gold at 2012 Global Cheese Awards.

Its texture is soft, thick and smooth with scatterings of air pockets. Yellowish ivory in colour, Tetilla has a creamy mouthfeel with buttery, slightly bitter and tangy flavours surrounding the palate. The maturing, which takes place between 10 and 30 days, happens in the hot and humid climate of Galicia.Try Tetilla with a dry, full-bodied wine, sherry, young whites, manzanilla and especially the Galician whites - Albariño or Ribeiro.

The cheese is produced from cow's milk and aged 5 to 6 months.Reggianito was also responsible for Parmigiano Reggiano receiving the PDO status since Italian cheesemakers feared the Argentinean version would become a serious threat to their export market.Less expensive than Parmigiano Reggiano, Reggianito is often sold as Parmesan in the United States.

It has a smooth pinkish to coppery orange rind and a cream-coloured, smooth and supple interior. There are small openings (\"eyes\") distributed throughout the paste. The cheese is surface-ripened for more than 6 weeks during which it develops flavours of fresh mushrooms, nuts and milk and a very slightly acidic aroma. As the cheese ripens, these flavours intensify and become more robust.  When young, Noyan is not too strong and can be used to add flavour to many types of sauces. As it matures, its enhanced flavours add quite bit of zing to quiches, soups and au gratin dishes. It also pairs deliciously with crusty bread or crackers and fruits such as apple or grapes.",

Delice de Bourgogne was created by Jean and Fromagerie Lincet in 1975. The cheese is made by blending full-fat cow's milk with crème fraîche to create an incredibly delicious soft cheese with a rich flavour and a smooth, melt-in-the-mouth texture. Unlike many simple triple crème kinds of cheese, Delice de Bourgogne has a white, bloomy and pungent rind because of the Penicillium Candidum mould. The mushroomy aroma of thin rind adds a playful contrast to the rich, creamy, buttery and tangy notes of the interior. This high-fat cheese pairs very well with Champagne, Meursault, Ciders and Wheat Beers.",

It is strong in taste and sold in plastic containers. Requesón from Brazil is a white cream cheese with mild taste. Requesón is served with honey, jam, or sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon.

Traditional Oltermanni is a creamy, buttery, mild flavoured cheese that is moderately smooth, though not as soft and spreadable as goat cheese. It can be cut into wedges or slices and served with fresh fruits like pears, grapes or plums or wines such as Merlot or Pinot Grigio. However, a contemporary and spreadable form of Oltermanni has made it a cheese for sandwiches, sauces and soups.Though original Oltermanni is available in a tightly wrapped cylinder form, newer introductions come in tubs with peelable tops to make it easy to open and store. Oltermanni is a rich cheese with high-fat content. ",

Flavours are evocative of mushrooms, cultured butter and earth, while aromas remind of wet stone. The pyramids are aged at Murray's state-of-the-art caves, during which they are allowed to develop a rich nutty and intensely citric-flavoured paste. Pair the cheese with dried fruit, toasted hazelnuts and a Lambic, Pilsner, or light-bodied red such as Beaujolais.

It is sometimes compared to mild cheddar because of the texture, but Derby is milder with a buttery, creamy flavour and strong melting ability.Only a few farms in England make Derby cheese the time-honoured way. Traditional Derby matured for nine months has an open texture with a smooth, creamy body and a nutty flavour. Due to its melting characteristics, it is used in many dishes. It goes well with fresh fruits and Chenin Blanc or Sauvignon Blanc. ",

It is a variety of Gouda that is taken through a series of maturation stages in an entirely natural way. In fact, the ageing of Reypenaer is the highlight of the cheese which takes place in a 100-year-old warehouse along the Oude Rijn river in controlled conditions.There are three different varieties of Reypenaer segregated according to its age. Reypenaer XO reserve is the king of the Reypenaer cheeses. It is matured for 3 years in special cells that were built back in 1906. Reypenaer XO reserve is a limited edition cheese made using only the finest ingredients such as the milk of cows allowed to roam outside in the Dutch summers. The mild summer temperatures combined with the high level of humidity of the cellars produce a cheese that has a uniquely rich, pure flavour. It develops protein crystallisations and white spots throughout the pate which lends it its distinctive taste and aromas.",

  "description": "Wensleydale is an historic fresh, mild cheese that has been made in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire since 1150 by Cistercian monks. These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep’s milk was used, but over the time cow’s milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer’s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow’s milk with sheep’s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wenslydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire.Extra Mature Wensleydale, matured for nine months is the strongest Wensleydale produced by Wensleydale Creamery. It is placed on shelves in the atmospherically - controlled maturing room. Wensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of cheeseboard where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavours rule the roost. It complements fruity white wine such as Pinot Grigio.",

It takes between 2 weeks to 2-3 months for the cheese to ripen fully.During the making process, the cheese is covered with an aromatic coating of rosemary, fennel seeds, juniper berries and the occasional bird's eye chilli. With age, the cheese is dotted with blue-grey moulds as the pate absorbs the herbal flavours of the rind. The strong characteristic flavours of the cheese are balanced by the delicate herbs.

  "description": "Tomme du Haut-Richelieu, simply called as Richelieu, is a Canadian cheese made by cheesemaker Fritz Kaiser in the late 90s. The cheese shares an interesting invention story which had the fromagerie in two minds over the extra goat milk they received to make its soft cheese Chevrochon. So Kaiser decided to use the additional goat milk to make a firmer cheese that would have a longer shelf life and a good ageing possibility. Thus was born Tomme du Haut-Richelieu, a firm cheese which has a pale orange, smooth washed rind covered in a thin, white mould. Inside the paste turns a soft beige at the wheel edge, lightening as it centres towards the middle. The aroma is hay like with a nutty and milky flavour. It has a typical yet subtle goaty tang and a melt-in-the-mouth taste that intensifies as the cheese ages. ",

  "description": "Gouda, or \"How-da\", as the locals say, is a Dutch cheese named after the city of Gouda in the Netherlands. If truth be told, it is one of the most popular cheeses globally, accounting for 50 to 60% of the world's cheese consumption. There are several types of Gouda, classified by age. From all of these, hard-core Gouda fans prefer to taste the aged Gouda, as they feel it takes years of maturing to bring out the complex flavours of the cheese.Aged Gouda is prepared similar to other Gouda cheeses by separating curds and whey through a heating process. As with all other cheeses, aged Gouda gets its colour by adding a colouring agent called annatto. With ageing, Gouda develops calcium lactate crystals formed by the lactic acid in the cheese. It proffers an enjoyable crunch that is unique to waxed cheeses. However, the rind of a five-year aged Gouda is unfit for human consumption.The longer a cheese is kept in maturation cellars, the more aromatic and full-flavoured it becomes. Similarly, Aged Gouda, such as a five-year aged cheese, develops a strong flavour that cheese aficionados prefer to eat alone. Accompaniments seem pale in comparison to their caramel and robust flavour.Gouda cheese goes well with beer and red wines. The taste of Vintage or Aged Gouda gets a new definition when paired with some white wines and fruity wines.",

It is very similar to Gruyere or Cheddar cheese but with a distinctly softer texture. The cheese is aged for 6 months if made with whole milk and 4 months if prepared with skimmed milk. However, to explore the intense attributes of the cheese, Herrgardsost can be aged for up to 12 or even 24 months.It is good table cheese ideal for snacking, melting and crumbling. It is served as a starter with crusty bread or crackers. Enjoy it by melting it on sandwiches or into a salad. Merlot wine is recommended with Herrgardsost to bring out the best from each other.",

  "description": "Aisy Cendre is a traditional French farmhouse cheese made from pasteurised cow’s milk. The semi-soft cheese produced in the Burgundy region of France is coated with a thick layer of ash that gives a distinctive flavour and aroma. Also known as Cendre d'Aisy, the ash or cendre in French, gives the cheese its name.A washed-rind cheese, mostly an Époisses, is matured by covering with oak or grapevine ash. Before and after rolling it with a coat of ash, the cheese is washed in Marc de Bourgogne wine. Aisy Cendre takes a longer time to mature than normal cheeses, at least a month. As it ripens the pate softens but most cheese lovers enjoy a somewhat firm version of the produce.The aroma of Aisy Cendre is strong and the flavour is aggressive. It is a very rich & creamy cheese with 50% fat content. The centre of the cheese is salty, chalky and almost white in colour. As it moves towards the ash-covered rind, the cheese assumes a smoky flavour and smoother, creamier texture. The cheese is sold in small wheels, weighing 8 ounces each.Aisy Cendre works well with fruits like apples and pears, celery sticks. It enhances the tasting experience for fruity, full-bodied Burgundy wine, Hautes Cotes de Nuits Villages or even a full-rounded beer.",

At the creamery, the milk is given heat shock treatment to ensure the protection of the beneficial enzymes in the milk, while also killing harmful bacteria. Vegetable rennet is added to coagulate the milk. Annato is added to give the cheese a consistent colour. The whey is separated from the curds, which are placed on a wide mat. The curds are salted, stirred and pressed before being transformed into blocks of cheese. The cheddar blocks are then placed in an airtight, moisture-proof bags and are left to age. Each batch is tested by analysts to ensure the quality of the cheese.The cheddar cheese blocks vary in taste, texture and smell depending on how long it has been aged. It can be aged from anywhere from 60 days to more than two years. The flavour can range from mild to sharp, depending on the ageing. A sharp Tillamook cheddar cheese can be paired with; Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah/Shiraz or Sauvignon Blanc; and mild or medium cheddar can be best paired with Pinot Noir, Sparkling Wine or champagne.",

  "description": "Allium Piper, a goat's milk cheese is a blend of two South Australian products namely 'Woodside Chevre' made from fresh local goats milk and 'Allisford Farm Organic Hand Harvested Garlic'.Goat milk from Towerview and Oskjberg dairies is used for making the Chevre (meaning Goat in French). After pasteurization the milk is allowed to set using traditional method. Very next day curd is drained for several hours. Very small amount of salt, crushed garlic cloves and little black pepper is added to the curd, and then the mixture is allowed to drain for about 10 days in a controlled environment.This elegant, fresh, white cheese is perfect for cheese board. There is no intense goaty taste, typically associated with goat milk cheeses. It has a characteristic spicy flavour with notes of garlic and pepper. This delicious cheese can be eaten with crusty bread.",

  "description": "Gouda, or \"How-da\" as the locals say, is a Dutch cheese named after the city of Gouda in the Netherlands. If truth be told, it is one of the most popular cheeses in the world, accounting for 50 to 60% of the world's cheese consumption. It is a semi-hard cheese celebrated for its rich, unique flavour and smooth texture. The original cheese market in Gouda is one of the last standing commercial cheese markets in the Netherlands. Since the name is not protected, it has become a generic classification for all cheeses produced and sold under the name Gouda.Gouda is typically made from pasteurised cow’s milk although some artisan varieties use sheep’s or goat’s milk to produce it. Boerenkaas is a typical variety of unpasteurised Gouda cheese produced by the farmers from the milk of cows grazing on the natural, low pastures of the Netherlands. There are seven different types of Gouda cheese, categorized depending on age. Graskaas is young Gouda ready to be consumed within a few weeks of production. On the other hand, is the extra-aged, Overjarig cheese which has a full-flavoured, hard, golden interior and salty flavour reminiscent of toffee. Between the spectrums is a variety of Dutch Gouda classified as per the texture and age - Jong, Jong belegen, Belegen, Extra belegen, and Oud. The waxed rind of the cheese also changes by age as soft, younger Dutch Gouda cheese is identified by yellow, orange, or red wax rinds white mature cheese has black wax coverings.In America, smoother and less flavourful commercial Gouda is more popular than Dutch Gouda. Artisans in the Netherlands may produce Dutch Gouda using raw milk as well as pasteurised milk.  To enhance the flavour of the cheese, herbs, seasonings, and nuts are added. In the Netherlands, aged Gouda is commonly used to in soups and sauces.Young Gouda is best paired with beer while medium-aged Gouda tastes best when paired with a fruity Riesling or Chenin Blanc. A well-aged Gouda complements wines that are deeply flavoured such as a rich Merlot or Shiraz. Gouda cheese may be grated, sliced, cubed or melted. It may be used as a table cheese or dessert cheese.",

  "description": "Rigotte, also known as Rigotte de Condrieu is a type of artisanal cheese made in the Lyonnaise region of France. The word is probably derived from the French town of Condrieu, some 40kms south of Lyon.Though Rigotte sounds similar to Ricotta, it is not produced by recooking the milky whey. In the 1930s, the farmers had to dilute goat's milk with cow's to produce the cheese due to the scarcity of goatherds. But, today, they produce this rare cheese from goat's milk.Rigotte can be eaten fresh, but the actual flavours develop on maturity. The pate becomes slightly moist, and the rind becomes nearly dry and finely wrinkled after maturation. The nutty, delicate flavour of honey and acacia will leave a wonderful taste in the mouth.It goes with Condrieu, red wines like Cornas and maybe a white St. Joseph.",

  "description": "Alma Vorarlberger Bergkäse (10 months) is a traditionally produced hard cheese made from raw cow milk coming from defined regions in Vorarlberg. It is manufactured by Rupp AG in Austria and sold under the brand name 'Alma'. Vorarlberger Bergkäse contains 34% fat in dry matter and has a light brown, lubricated bark. The isolated, pea-cherry-sized eye formation is matt to shiny and evenly distributed throughout. Sometimes there are cracks in the dough as a result of extended maturation. The paste is flaky, cut resistant and is unpainted yellowish in colour. It is aged in cellars for at least 10 months, which thereby develops a distinct, strong flavour. A powerful Pinot Blanc or a fruity, delicate wine with good body (Burgundy, Blue Franc) harmonizes perfectly with the spicy flavour of Vorarlberger Bergkäse.This celebrated cheese has won many international awards including World Cheese Awards Super Gold 2012, World Cheese Awards Silver 2012, World Cheese Awards Gold 2013, World Cheese Awards Silver 2014, World Cheese Awards Bronze 2014 and Gold Kasermandl 2014. ",

This artisanal, award-winning cheese is made only in the winters when the Ayrshire cows are giving rich, hay-fed raw milk.The cheese is handmade and washed with locally brewed beer to develop its blushing pink washed-rind appearance. Young cheeses are wrapped in strips of spruce cambium to instil the deep and moderate woodsy flavour.

Besides the cheese, even today, every clay brick manufactured at Almnas has a child's footprint imprinted on it.Almnäs Tegel is a huge cheese, weighing approximately 27 kgs. It has a rustic, brick red washed-rind achieved by smearing it with a bacterial culture called Brevibacterium linens. The interior paste is smooth, with occasional small holes and cracks. The colour varies from ivory to straw, depending on the season when it is made. It has a sweet, fruity aroma, reminiscent of butterscotch with a slightly gritty mouth-feel. The rind at times smells of orange or pineapple. Almnäs Brick is aged between 18 and 30 months.",

It is molded in a tiny conical shape that is only around 8 cm high and 5 cm wide at the base. The rind is white, soft and bloomy very lightly dusted with ash. The insides are a creamish white colour with a texture typical of goat’s cheeses i.e. crumbly, flaky and almost chalky.Grabetto is sold in three types - fresh, semi-mature and mature. The flavour of fresh Grabetto is nutty which becomes sharp and tangy as it ages. Its aroma is reminiscent of herbs and grass.",

The cheese takes about 12 -15 days to attain full maturity, but it can be ripened for a longer period to make it a bit stronger. After maturation for months, it develops a more intense flavour. It is a white, ivory cream cheese with velvety skin. Because of its nutty flavour, it tastes great when consumed on hot toast or in salads. It pairs well with Red Wine. ",

  "description": "A Green Dirt Farm original, Dirt Lover is styled on the lines of French ash coated cheeses like Selles-sur-Cher and Valençay. It has an edible bloomy rind enveloping an underlying layer of vegetable ash. When cut, it reveals black border of ash underneath the bloomy white rind, which is the inspiration behind the name. In spring, the cheese has a firm, dense texture with savoury notes from the ash balanced by the nuttiness of the pate. In summer, the firm texture develops a creamy ring under the ash which expands as the cheese ages. With age, Dirt Lover becomes intense, earthy and buttery with a hint of citrusy tang. It is aged for a minimum of two weeks, finally reaching its optimum maturation at six to eight weeks.A coveted medal winner at the 2013 American Cheese Society competition, Dirt Lover pairs perfectly with IPAs, Pale Ales, and Lambic. If you are a wine lover, try Sancerre, Sauternes, Prosecco or any other sparkling wines.",

The other versions are much milder than the original Fontina. There is also a Danish version which can be recognised by the red wax rind. Italian Fontina has a natural rind that turns orange-brown with ageing.Fontina Val d'Aosta is traditionally made from unpasteurised cow's milk. The texture and flavour of the cheese depending on how long it has aged. The texture can vary from semi-soft to firm, and the flavours can go from mild and rich to more robust and overpowering. Usually, Fontina is aged for 90 days.The interior of Fontina is pale cream and riddled with holes known as \"eyes\". With a fat content of 45%, the cheese is very rich and creamy, which gets nuttier with ageing. This versatile cheese is used to make fondues and similar Italian dishes. Nebbiolo, red wine with wild cherry and truffles, is a match for Fontina.",

  "description": "Woodside Charleston is an Australian Brie-style cheese that is made from Jersey cow’s milk collected from Charleston in the Adelaide Hills. The exclusive flavour of Charleston is a result of the different moulds that ripen the cheese from the outside to the centre over a period of about six weeks. When the cheese is fully ripe, it exhibits a soft and creamy texture and a complex ‘farmyardy’ flavour underlined by mushroomy notes. With age, the flavours of Charleston intensify and become more distinctive. As the cheese is free of any preservatives, some discolouration on the outer rind is treated as a natural part of its maturation. Determine the ripeness of Charleston by feeling the softness all across the surface. The cheese has a shelf life of 7 to 8 weeks from the make date. Charleston pairs well with Chardonnay or sparkling wine and are best suited to cheese plate when matched with fresh bread and seasonal fruit.",

It is also a blue veined Italian soft cheese sometimes referred to as Gorgonzola Dolce. Its production involves the same process used to make Gorgonzola with a difference that it is made from the curd of only one milking. The maturation involves about two to three months with sweet and a bit milder taste. The fat content in Dolcelatte is higher than Gorgonzola at about 50%. Suitable for vegetarians, it is served with grapes, used in a rich pasta sauce, and paired with Rose or Juicy Red, Port wine, and Venetian Merlot wines.",

Don Bernardo Manchego boasts of delicate herbal notes and overtones of nuts with a pronounced peppery body.The Manchego sold by President is a 6-9 month aged \"Viejo\", meaning it has a more complex, rich and lingering flavour. When purchasing, make sure to look for the PDO label, as this assures an authentic Manchego cheese.Enjoy Don Bernardo Manchego with full-flavoured fruits, fruit pastes, and cured meats, vegetables, on bread or crackers. Pale Ales, Wheat Beer, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo will do full justice to the complex flavours of Manchego.",

The recipe for the cheese was passed down through generations wherein it was dictated that the raw cow’s milk cheese be made with kid goat rennet.This pale yellow, hard cheese is aged on the location of the old farm. Its pate is crumbly and flakes easily, but is suitable for grating. The rind is rubbed with extra virgin olive oil produced on the same farm.Don Carlo has a salty taste and an intense flavour that becomes pronounced with age. The presence of kid goat rennet gives the cheese a pleasantly spicy kick. Aromatic white wines or young red wine make a great match with this interesting cheese.",

  "description": "Grana refers to a family of hard, mature cheeses from Italy with a granular, flaky texture and are mainly used for grating. Around the world, Grana is a generic term used to define three main varieties of cheeses namely - Parmigianino Reggiano, Grana Padano and Grana Trentino and other smaller variants like Granone Lodigiano, Trentingrana and Gransardo. However, in Europe, the word 'Grana' is legally protected by Grana Padano Protected Designation of Origin. Only Grana Padano can use the term to sell its produce in EU countries.The most popular Grana Italian cheeses are of course Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano. True Parmigianino Reggiano, named after the Provinces of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna and Mantua, where it is produced, has a hard, gritty texture and is fruity and nutty in taste.On the other hand, Grana Padano refers to the valley Pianura Padana where it is made. Though similar to Parmigianino Reggiano, young Grana Padano is slightly less crumbly, milder and less complex than its famous, aged kin. On the other hand, Grana Trentino follows the same method to produce Parmigianino Reggiano but is made in the province of Trento, giving it its name.All three main varieties of Grana cheese carry the label DOP. (Denomination of Protected Origin), guaranteeing their authenticity and origin of production methods.",

  "description": "Grana Padano, granted DOP on 12 June 1996, is one of the few kinds of cheese that can compete with the King of Cheeses; Parmigiano-Reggiano. Created by the Cistercian monks of Chiaravalle in the 12th century, it is still made throughout the Po River Valley in northeastern Italy.The cheese is made from unpasteurised, semi-skimmed cow’s milk from two milkings and generally aged for two years. At the end of the cheese-making process, Grana Padano develops a firm, thick and deeply straw-coloured rind protecting the fragrant, dry, flaking interior. Grana means “grainy” in Italian, which is reflected in the fine granular texture with an intensely sweet flavour. As Grana Padano ages, the flavours become pronounced, savoury and complex, and the texture becomes more crumbly.Though similar to Parmigiano, Reggiano Grana Padano is inexpensive cheese. Moreover, Grana is less crumbly, milder and less complex than its long-aged sibling.Grana Padano is manufactured in cylindrical wheels measuring 35 to 45 cm in diameter and 15 to 18 cm in height. It is sold at different ripening stages: Grana Padano (9 to 16 months), Grana Padano oltre 16 mesi (over 16 months) and Grana Padano Riserva (over 20 months).Try pairing the cheese with a Barolo, Zinfandel or Gavi white wine.",

  "description": "Romano is a hard cheese of Italian origin prepared predominantly using cow's or sheep's or goat's milk or mixtures of two or all of these. Made since the 1st century B.C., there are several types of Romano cheese. Determined by the type of milk used, the name of Romano cheeses may be preceded by the word Vaccino (cow’s milk), Pecorino (sheep’s milk) or Caprino (goat’s milk). The most famous example of Romano cheese is Pecorino Romano, an exclusive Italian cheese with DOP designation from the Italian government.  One of the most popular Italian cheeses, Romano cheese, is made from pasteurised or unpasteurised milk using animal, plant, or microbial rennet. It has a grainy texture and a hard and brittle rind. The curing of Romano takes not less than five months and longer if it is planned for grating.Every Romano cheese has its own peculiarities and shows different shades in texture and flavour. While Pecorino Romano, made from sheep’s milk, is sharp and quite tangy, the Caprino Romano made from goat’s milk, has an extremely sharp taste. The third variety made from cow’s milk, Vacchino Romano, is very mild in flavour.Romano cheese is a table cheese that can be grated over pasta, soups and salad or shaved onto cooked dishes and cream sauces. It pairs well with fruity wines like Riesling and Prosecco. ",

Tomme de Savoie is one such variety of Tomme cheese made in the Savoie region of northwestern France.Tomme de Savoie is made from raw, skimmed cow’s milk after the cream is drained to make butter. That is why it contains 20-40% fat. The taste of the cheese varies throughout the year depending on whether the milk comes from cows eating winter hay or fresh summer grass. The maturing takes around 2-4 months, during which the cheese starts developing a thick grey rind with patches of yellow or red moulding. Tomme de Savoie is a semi-soft, pressed cheese with a pliable, firm texture and grassy, nutty flavour. It has numerous irregular eyes spread throughout the ivory-coloured paste with some tangy, slightly citrusy and mushroomy notes underlined by the odours of a cave.The cheese pairs well with medium-bodied red wines from Côtes du Rhône, sausages, fruits and bread.",

This brine washed, surface ripened cheese is produced from the raw milk of Jersey and Brown Swiss cows. For making the recipe of this cheese, Mark Gilman worked with French and Belgian cheese makers. It is aged for two months to produce a soft creamy interior and a gorgeous orange rind. When young, the texture tends to have a slightly chalky centre with a softer paste just under the rind, becoming runnier as the cheese ages. Similarly, the pleasant grassy, savoury and vegetal flavours tend to become more assertive with maturity and at their optimum are certainly only for acquired tastes. Sweet wines and beers pair delicious with this cheese.",

  "description": "Dorset Blue Vinney (Dorset Blue Vinny) is a British cheese made near Sturminster Newton in the heart of Dorset, using cow milk. Earlier it was made using skimmed milk and was a common farmhouse cheese in Dorset. Following the Second World War, the production of Dorset Blue Vinny stopped entirely. In the early 1980s, Michael Davies resurrected a 300-year-old recipe for Dorset Blue Vinny and started making the cheese again. Today, Dorset Blue Vinny is produced on the same farm where Michael started making it, using the same recipe with one or two modern twists.It is often made using unpasteurised milk, and the ageing process takes from 15 to 18 weeks. This crumbly textured cheese has a strong flavour and has 30% of fat content. It is best paired with red wine or port wine.",

  "description": "Produced in the Auvergne region, Fourme d'Ambert (or simply Ambert) is one of France's oldest cheeses, dating back to the Roman occupation nearly 1,000 years ago. It is said that the Druids and the Gauls had developed the art of making this unique cheese. In 2002 it was separated from the Fourme de Montbrison, an identical cheese, to receive an individual AOC status.The cheese is a traditional, farmhouse blue cheese that can be either co-operative or artisanal. Fourme d'Ambert is more supple and dense than most blues. Milk from cows grazing on either lower or higher mountain pastures is used to produce the cheese. Although the cheese matures in 40 days, it is cave-aged for two-three months for optimum quality. During the ageing time, it is injected with Vouvray moelleux, a sweet white wine. It is easily recognizable by its unusually tall cylindrical shape.The pâté is cream coloured with prominent blue veining. The cheese is inoculated with Penicillium roqueforti spores for the growth of blue veins. Slightly tangy, savoury flavour infused by the bacteria, beautifully complements the distinct notes of butter and cream.Wine connoisseurs can enjoy the cheese with Sauternes and other dessert wines as well as full-bodied reds such as Rhone’s, Pinot Noirs and Syrah. Similar cheeses include Fourme de Montbrison, Bleu de Montbrison, Bleu de Gex and Bleu de Septmoncel. Try the cheese as a snack with bread and fruit or crumble it on salads.",

Usually, Tommes are cheeses produced from skimmed milk after removing the cream to make butter and full cream cheeses. As a result, they are low in fat.Cheeses belonging to this class adopt the name of their place of origin, the most famous being Tomme de Savoie from Savoie in the French Alps. Other Tomme cheeses include Tomme du Revard, Tomme Boudane, Tomme au Fenouil, Tomme de Grandmère, Tomme d'Aydius, Tomme Affinée and Tomme de Crayeuse.Tomme is a complex cheese with a milky and buttery aroma. The texture is semi-soft or firm. Its pate is often white to light yellow and is covered with ivory to a yellow rind.The cheese tastes delicious with fresh or dried fruit and a glass of red wine.",

Torta del Casar is a very rare cheese since it is made from the milk of Merino and thistle rennet (NON-GMO, 100% flower extract rennet) which gives a sour and tangy taste.Torta del Casar is vegetarian produce coagulated with cardoon, a wild thistle that adds a slightly bitter note to the cheese. The cheese, rich and slightly salty in taste, is aged for at least 60 days, upon which it develops a semi-hard, yellow to an ochre crust and a soft, spreadable, creamy, almost runnier paste.Torta del Casar can be enjoyed as an appetizer or dessert, spread on bread with a glass of dry, red wine.",

  "description": "Hoop Cheese (also known as Bakers or Red Ring cheese) is a simple, traditional cheese made only from cow's milk, where the whey has been drained out completely and then placed in a round mould called a hoop. Some people call it Red Ring cheese because of the red wax coating. Though sometimes compared to farmer's cheese, it is different because no cream or salt is added to the cheese. Since the cheese is not aged, the texture remains soft and it spoils very fast. These days it is very rare to find the cheese commercially because of its neutral taste and short-lived shelf life. It is available in small grocery shops, gas stations and restaurants in the south of the United States where the farmer or grocer sells the cheese fresh off the wheel.Hoop cheese is a mild, slightly salty cheese with a rubbery texture when young which becomes sharp and crumbly if allowed to age. The colour of the pate is rich yellow with a subtle nutty flavour. It is an excellent cooking ingredient that is used to give a creamy texture to the dish without changing the flavour or making it stickier. Use it to make grilled sandwiches, macaroni and cheese or have it with crackers or fruits.",

With fat percent tipping the scales at nearly 75%, the ultra rich buttery taste and very creamy texture of Grand Vatel makes it a favorite dessert cheese. The cheese has a thin, bloomy rind due to a coating of light penicillin mold. Aging of Grand Vatel takes about two months with one more month in packaging. As the cheese ages, it acquires a mushroomy and a refreshing citrusy taste. The cheese sold in small cylinder shaped rounds should be consumed within a week of purchase. Try pairing this cheese with grapes or pears and light, fruity wines like Vouvray.",

It smells musty and woody due to the ageing on spruce boards. The flavour is milky with a hint of woodiness and frankly, too mild for a blue cheese. Cheese connoisseurs who are ready to experiment with blue cheeses could start with Fourme de Montbrison. The cheese received its French AOC status in 1972 along with Fourme d'Ambert Cheese. In 2002, the two cheeses received their own separate AOC status realizing the difference in the manufacturing process.",

  "description": "Double Gloucester is a traditional, full fat, hard cheese made from pasteurised or unpasteurised cow's milk. The cheese, made from the milk of once nearly extinct Old Gloucester cows, traces its origins to 1498 in the City of Gloucester.Gloucester comes in both single and double varieties. While Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk, Double Gloucester uses full fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavourful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses the whole milk taken from two milking or a mixture of milk and cream. The double variety has a smooth and buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour thanks to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used and the cheese is aged for at least 4 months. If the cheese is allowed to age further, it will develop more complex and nutty flavours. Moreover, the texture tends to become very hard and flaky.Double Gloucester participates every year in the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. A traditional British Ale or red like Syrah will perfectly complement a Double Gloucester.Double Gloucester A has won many international awards including Silver medal at 2014 World Cheese Awards.",

It is rindless with cream to light yellow paste, homogeneous with small open \"eyes\" holes.When young, Gouda is quite mild in flavour, but acquires quite a bit of sharpness as it ages. This semi-hard cheese is almondy and creamy to taste with spicy, herbal notes coming from available variations: medium, aged, cumin, caraway, peppercorn, jalapeno, garlic chives, herb garlic, smoked.Gouda is excellent by itself but tastes delicious with a glass of red wine, fruit or raw vegetables, sandwiches, stuffed pancakes or in au gratin soup.",

  "description": "American cheese is processed cheese made from a blend of milk, milk fats and solids, other fats and whey protein concentrate. Earlier, it was made from a mixture of cheeses, more often than not Colby and Cheddar. Since blended cheeses are no longer used, it cannot be legally called “cheese” and has to be labelled as “processed cheese”, “cheese product“, etc. Sometimes, it is called \"American slices\" or \"American singles\" instead of the word cheese. Under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, American cheese is a type of pasteurised processed cheese.The taste and texture of American cheese vary depending on the usage of cheese and additives. Also, the colour may change from orange and yellow to white from manufacturer to manufacturer. Processed American cheese is sold in three varieties – individually wrapped cheese slices, small pre-sliced blocks and large blocks. Although criticized for its high fat and sodium content, American cheese is still used in cooking as it melts well and contains a good amount of calcium and protein.",

This cheese unites two regions of France in the Western Pyrénées: Ossau valley of Bearn and Iraty Forest of Basque Country. It received an AOC protection in 1980, which requires that the cheese be produced with the milk of only two breeds of ewes - Manech and Basco-Béarnaise.An uncooked and pressed cheese, Ossau-Iraty is semi-hard in texture with a thick, buff rind marked with rust and grey moulds. Beneath the brown and orange rind is an ivory white, supple and slightly grainy interior that has a creamy and buttery mouth feel. Flavours are herbaceous, nutty and fruity if the produce is from winter while the summer cheeses tend to reveal aromas of grass and flowers.Matured for at least 6 months, Ossau-Iraty often comes in a flat cylindrical shape. There are three main sizes available, small (Petit-Ossau-Iraty-Brebis Pyrenes), intermediate (non-fermier) and large (fermier). It is sometimes dusted with paprika leaves to add a kick of flavour. It tastes delicious with fruity red, full-bodied red or white wines such as Zinfandel, Tempranillo or Syrah.",

Now it is an industrial cheese made using pasteurized cow's milk.The production of the cheese dates back to 1868 from the original recipe transferred to the Coudre sisters by the monks of the Notre-Dame-du-Port-du-Salut Abbey. At that time, the sisters were making the cheese from the raw milk of cows sourced from local farmers. From 1995 they subcontracted the manufacturing of the cheese to a company and kept the maturing process in the vaulted cellars of the Coudre Abbey.",

  "description": "Dreux a la Feuille, also spelt as Feuille de Dreux is a creamy, soft French cheese made from cow’s milk in the Eure-et-Loir area. The cheese is wrapped in chestnut leaves to strengthen its taste and tell apart from similar Brie style cheeses in the region. During the ripening period, the leaves change their colour and texture from firm, forest green to brittle, copper brown colour, in turn imparting the cheese with an earthy flavour. Dreux a la Feuille has a distinguishing mushroomy aroma and full-bodied flavour. It is coated with a bloomy rind of white penicillin mould underneath which lies an uncooked, unpressed, yellow interior that is soft on the palate. The cheese has a fat percentage of around 40% and goes well with a Chinon.",

  "description": "La Trappe Bricquebec is a semi-soft French monastic cheese invented in 1824 by Dom Augustin Onfroy in a small village of Cotentin. The Trappist monks of the Abbey of Bricquebec continued with the tradition of producing high-quality cheeses until WWII. But in the post-war period, the farmers faced stiff competition from other monastic societies who were producing cheeses. In 1961, the abbey sold the brand \"La Providence” to the Valco society in Valognes.Trappiste de Bricquebec is a pasteurised cow's milk cheese with a smooth, glossy rind of a greyish-yellow colour. It gives off a strong smell of the cellars where it is matured at least for 6 weeks and shaped into a flat disc. The texture of the cheese is supple, smooth and dense with a nutty, mild flavour with a spicy finish. It has a fat content of around 28%. The buttery taste of the cheese goes well with bread, fruits and nuts. It tastes delicious with Muscadet, St. Emilion or any light red or dry light white wine.",

Fresh Anari is white, soft with a mild sweet creamy taste. This cheese is very rich in protein and low on fat, due to which it can be easily digested. It is mildly salted and usually served at breakfast with honey, jam or filled in pastries. Fresh Anari should be consumed soon as it is very perishable. When Anari is salted and air-dried in the sun or in an oven, it achieves a very hard and brittle cheese with a mild salty taste. Dry Anari is too hard to cut and is hence grated and used in garnishing pasta dishes.",

However, it is as strong or robust flavoured as its Hispanic cousin, Cotija.Añejo means \"aged\" in Spanish. When fresh and young, the cheese is crumbly and breaks into small pieces very easily. As it ages, the cheese becomes firmer, allowing it to be easily shredded or grated. It is frequently used in baking and grilling, particularly in making burritos, enchiladas and tacos.",

It was initially produced in the 1980s by Fromagerie Triballat in the Center region of France. Made with pasteurised cow’s milk; the cheese is easily recognisable due to the distinctive swirl pattern. This North-East French produce has a creamy, melt-in-the-mouth texture with a combination of fresh herbs or cranberry or pineapple added in for that extra zing.The  Garlic and herb Roulé is made from cheese logs rolled up on garlic and herbs, It can be easily sliced and enjoyed with bread.The Cranberry Roule is versatile and tastes great when spread on fresh bread or included in a sandwich.In the Pineapple Roule, pieces of pineapple provide a delightful bite while the creamy taste of cheese melts in the mouth.",

This runny shell will widen as the cheese matures and is considered the best part of the cheese by many. The bloomy mould and ash rind is edible but relatively tasteless. The cheese is creamy, light, powdery, slightly lemony and mildly goaty.Humboldt Fog is available from a mini 1 lbs. cheese wheel (Humboldt Fog® Mini) up to the large 5 lbs. cheese wheel (Humboldt Fog® Grande).The cheese won first place at the American Cheese Society in 1998, 2002, 2005 and 2019.

The pasteurised version is mild in flavour, whereas the one made from fresh, unpasteurised milk is more strong in flavour (called Farmhouse Tilsit). It is aged for about five months, which makes it a very strong-flavoured cheese similar to a Limburger. The third version is made from pasteurised milk with added cream.Tilsit displays a brownish-orange washed rind with a springy elastic semi-firm texture that is ideal for slicing. It is moist and creamy with spicy undertones. This cheese has a piquant flavour which makes it a perfect table cheese. It can be used in salads, added to sauces or melted over baked dishes.There are various producers around the world who make Tilsit under their brand’s name. This includes the one made on Heidi farms in Tasmania, Australia, called 'Heidi Tilsit'.Though the cheese was called Royalp Tilsit or Tilsiter in Switzerland, it is now simply called Tilsiter or Tilsit. Outside Switzerland, it is known by different names depending upon where it is produced. It is called Havarti Tilsit in Denmark, and Tilsiter or Tollenser in Germany.",

The cheese can be shredded, cooked, or sliced. You will never go wrong by grating Dry Jack over casseroles, toasted cheese sandwiches, omelettes and soufflés. Consider Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Rose, Shiraz or Zinfandel with a Dry Jack.",

Though the combination seems unusual, the English cheesemakers have made it possible by presenting a layered representation of the two cheeses. Stilton is sandwiched between layers of satiny Double Gloucester, resulting in a powerful flavour combination of the two.It is a difficult cheese to cook with, but visually stunning on a cheese platter. Each cheese could have its own wine pairing, but together they go well with ales and beers.",

Traditional, Swedish Hushållsost is mild, creamy and brings out flavours of clear salt and fresh acidity. It has a pale, straw-coloured interior with a smooth, open texture and small irregular holes. The low-fat version has a slightly buttery and nutty taste.Use the most popular cheese in Sweden in casseroles, sandwiches and pizza or add it to highlight any buffet or cheese platter.

  "description": "Dubliner is an original, award-winning Irish cheese that is named after the city of Dublin, though produced in County Cork. Developed by Irishman Jhon Lucey, the cheese is made from pasteurised cow's milk and is available in a number of varieties and flavours. An original Dubliner is a sweet, mild and mature cheese taking over 12 months to develop the sharp robust flavour and texture of mature cheddar, the nuttiness of Swiss cheese and the bite of Parmesan cheese. It has a high content of calcium, due to the calcium lactate crystals in the cheese. Some companies produce gluten free, diabetic and vegetarian friendly version of this cheese. A reduced fat Dubliner is also available in the market. The cheese goes well with a full-bodied wine like Cabernet or a pint of Guinness as well as with a fruity wine, Irish wine, or Oaky Chardonnay wine. It tastes delicious if melted between crusty brown bread slices. The cheese is also used to prepare sandwiches, pastas, or served with fruits like apples or pears. Remove the cheese from the fridge 30 minutes before consumption and enjoy 7 days after opening. ",

Regions of Macedonia, Thrace, Thessalia, Peloponissos, Ionian Islands, Aegean Islands, Crete Island and Epirus have been producing this cheese for centuries. The name Anthotyros literally translated means 'flower cheese', comes from the wafting aromas of wild herbs.Dry Anthotyros or Anthotyro Xero is a matured cheese available in a truncated cone or ball shape. If Anthotyros is left to age, thick salt is usually added to cover the exterior. Dry Anthotyros has a hard texture, salty taste and savoury flavour. It has a very powerful smell reminiscent of sherry. When aged, it is an excellent grating cheese and can be used to augment the taste of pasta, spaghetti or salads.There's a fresh version of Anthotyros called Anthotyro Fresco (Fresh Anthotyro).",

  "description": "Mozzarella has been the number one choice for many cheese-loving families for its delicate and fresh taste of milk. It is available in different forms and varieties, the foremost being fresh mozzarella or mozzarella fresco. It is a type of mozzarella that is just been made and ready to be consumed at room temperature. Fresh mozzarella balls are sold in a brine, whey or water solution to help them retain their moisture and shape.This cheese has a soft, moist texture and is full of milky flavour. Similar to other fresh cheeses, mozzarella fresco is high in water content and therefore low in fat. It has a slightly acidic or lactic taste. Compared to mass-processed mozzarellas, the freshly made variant is creamier and much softer. True buffalo mozzarella is highly appreciated around the world than the one made with cow’s milk.Fresh mozzarella’s firmer texture has gained popularity as a slicing cheese on pizzas or flatbreads, snacks, salads or vegetables. It pairs well with fresh tomatoes, pestos, fruits, olives, basil and tapenades. Try the cheese with cava or other sparkling wines. This cheese is available in curd form to pull your own fresh mozzarella by hand, logs or shape of balls called Bocconcini.These days fresh mozzarella is available in most supermarkets and Italian stores. Let the cheese soak in the brine solution until ready to consume and eat it within 2-3 days. Consuming fresh is recommended as it becomes bitter and sour with age.",

The natural rind of the cheese formed during maturation, is edible.The cheese is matured for 5 months during which it is turned daily in temperature controlled conditions. To make the smoked version of Duddleswell, the whole cheeses are lightly smoked over oak shavings for around 12 to 36 hours, depending on weather conditions. Duddleswell has received many awards including Gold at International Cheese Awards 2010 and 2011 and Bronze at British Cheese Awards 2010. All of the cheeses made at the dairy are suitable for vegetarians since only vegetable rennet is used during processing. Duddleswell pairs well with Merlot.

  "description": "Truffle Tremor is a soft-ripened goat's cheese produced by Cypress Grove Chevre, of Arcata, California, in Humboldt County. As the name suggests, it combines the earthiness of the Italian black summer truffles with tangy, lactic flavours of goat cheese. This elegant cheese has a dense, champagne-white interior mottled with small, delicate pieces of black truffle. As the cheese ripens, the paste becomes softer just under the rind, ensuring more herbaceous flavour.Serve the cheese with Barleywine, Trippel or wines such as Riesling, Zinfandel or Cabernet Sauvignon.The cheese won Super Gold award at World Cheese Awards 2014, Gold at California State Fair Cheese Competition, 2009, 2010 and First Place at World Championship Cheese Contest 2014.",

  "description": "Ricotta is an Italian fresh cheese made from sheep, cow, goat or buffalo's milk whey left over from the production of cheese. Since the casein is filtered away from whey during the cheese-making process, Ricotta is suitable for persons with casein intolerance. Being low in fat and high in protein, Ricotta is a dieter’s dream cheese.Traditional Italian fresh ricotta is smoother than cottage cheese and tastes mildly sweet. Good Ricotta is firm, not solid and consists of a mass of fine, moist, delicate grains, neither salted nor ripened. The light, delicate consistency and clean flavours make it a perfect accompaniment to a variety of recipes and dishes. Ricotta is a popular ingredient in many Italian dishes like lasagna, manicotti, cassata, cheesecake, calzone, pizza, and ravioli and dips. It is also suitable as a sauce thickener. Fresh Ricotta pairs great with Sauvignon Blanc.There are three distinct varieties of ricotta: ricotta salata moliterna (ewe's milk whey), ricotta piemontese (cow's milk whey + 10% milk) and ricotta romana (a byproduct of Romano cheese production).",

  "description": "Dunlop is a traditional hard Scottish cheese made from pasteurised cow's milk of the Ayrshire breed. Named after the village of Dunlop in East Ayrshire, Scotland, the cheese is made using vegetarian rennet, which makes it suitable for vegetarians. A sweet milk cheese, its popularity drizzled in the Second World War, but now it is appreciated for its pairings with whisky, recipes or eating on its own.Developed by Barbara Gilmour in the 1700s, the cheese shares similarities with Cheddar cheese but is softer. The cheese develops a nutty flavour and smooth, close texture when young. As it matures, the texture becomes firm and builds up sharp flavours. It is matured for a minimum of 6 months.Smoked Dunlop - a variant that is smoked over beechwood to add an extra smokey flavour.",

The cheese is smooth and creamy, with a richness and depth of flavour that owes much to the excellent grazing. The texture is firm and open and the flavour is aromatic, with a slightly sharp tang on the finish. Turunmaa is matured for two months or more and has a fat content of 50 percent. A similar cheese is Korsholm, Danish Cream Havarti. Like Cream Havarti, it is both a table cheese and a breakfast cheese to be served with fruit and bread.",

As they are traditionally called, Valais Raclette or Fromage a Raclette are made using traditional methods with unpasteurised milk of cows grazing on the alpine meadows. The name Raclette comes from the French word 'racler', which means 'to scrape'. The cheese has a thin, brownish-orange rind and a pale yellow pate with a few scattered open holes. It has a distinctive pleasant, aromatic smell with a creamy texture, similar to Gruyere cheeses, which do not separate even when melted. The flavour can vary from nutty, slightly acidic, to milky. While Switzerland supplies 80% of Raclettes, French Raclettes are slightly softer with a smooth and creamy flavour. Raclette is also a name of a Swiss dish. Raclette comes in round and square shapes and can be served with Vin de Savoie.",

Fermented white cheese marketed under the terms fresh or fresh cheese must contain live flora at the time of sale to the consumer.\" In simple language, Fromage Frais must contain live cultures when sold, whereas, with Fromage Blanc, fermentation has been stopped.Pure Fromage Blanc is almost fat-free, but the cream is added to augment its flavour, increasing its fat content making it nearly eight percent of total weight. It has a smooth, slightly citric flavour with a texture similar to ricotta. It is used in pastry fillings, pasta or served as a dessert with fruits.",

  "description": "Ardrahan is a semi-soft cheese made from pasteurised cow's milk by Eugene and Mary Burns in Duhallow - a County Cork town located south of Ireland. All the milk used in the cheese production comes from pedigree Friesians that graze on their beautiful farm. The brine-washed rind glows with golden and earthy moulds. Its paste is deep yellow in colour with a slightly chalky texture and earthy aroma. The cheese emits a flash of complex flavours emphasized by acidic, buttery and savoury attributes. Tasting of Ardrahan is reminiscent of a young Gruyere. The cheese matures in four to eight weeks.A smoked variety of Ardrahan has a brownish, smoked rind with semi-soft consistency and chalky texture. Its aroma resembles smoke, peanut butter with roasted coffee notes.Ardrahan is a handmade cheese prepared using only traditional methods, whole milk and vegetarian rennet. This yellow colour cheese contains about 25% fat and is available in a large and small wheel of 1.5kg and 300g, respectively.The cheese has won many awards including the Irish Food Writers Guild annual Good Food award, British Cheese Awards and the World Cheese Awards. It pairs well with a Pinot Noir, Chianti and Sangiovese.",

  "description": "Armenian string cheese also called Chechil is formed in long strings twisted together. It is a product that is peelable and when it is peeled, it separates from the larger cheese in strips. Most of the cheeses cannot be peeled because of the way they are processed. The curds are pressed into blocks resulting in the cheese either crumbling or breaking apart. In the case of string cheese, the curds are worked into elastic strips, which are then plaited or twisted. This creates fibres of cheese that can be pulled away in strings. Cow, sheep, and goat milk can be used in the preparation of string cheese. It is popular with children as it is an excellent source of protein and calcium.In the MidEast countries such as Armenia and Syria, traditional string cheese is prepared from goat or sheep’s milk. In some places, it is made from 100% whole milk of cow. The cheese is flavoured with various spices including black cumin, nigella seeds and a unique Middle Eastern spice known as mahleb. The cheese is available in an indefinite plaited loop. In Syria, string cheese is known by its Arabic name ‘Jibneh Mshallaleh’. Middle Eastern string cheese goes well with Lebanese bread and liquorice flavoured Greek liqueur, Ouzo.The flavour of Middle Eastern string cheese varies from velvety, buttery to a sharp, tangy one. Texturally, it is firm and flexible besides giving a thread feeling in the mouth. Many people associate Mozzarella with string cheese as it can be plucked apart in logs.",

  "description": "Fromage Frais is a soft, fresh, creamy fresh cheese made out of whole or skimmed milk and cream. A French speciality, traditionally, this cheese is made with cream. Many times, the term Fromage Frais is used interchangeably with Fromage Blanc, but according to the French legislation - \"The denomination fromage frais is reserved for unripened cheese that underwent a mostly lactic fermentation. Fermented white cheese marketed under the terms fresh or fresh cheese must contain live flora at the time of sale to the consumer.\" In simple language, Fromage Frais must contain live cultures when sold.The cheese in its original form is very bland to taste and extremely low in fat. Savoury spices, sweet berries and cream are added to improve the flavour, which also increases the fat content, sometimes as much as 8%.The cheese is used as a savoury appetizer or a creamy dessert by combining it with herbs, fruits and spices. Fromage Frais with a loose consistency, ranging between heavy and sour cream, is often used to thicken and richen sauces. It is a traditional accompaniment to caviar since the milky goodness of the cheese reduces the saltiness of the eggs.Fresh, creamy cheese like Fromage Frais pairs well with sparkling white wine, Zinfandel and fortified wines.",

It is also sometimes made with raw Jersey cow's milk sourced from Joe Severy's organic dairy in Cornwall. The wheels are aged for 65 days, during which the rinds are washed with brine made with lees from hard apple cider and whey. This gives it a semi-soft texture and a full flavour.This pink Tomme has a farmyard aroma of hay and earth, balanced by lighter goat flavours and a distinct savouriness common to washed rind cheeses.

  "description": "Asiago DOP (protected designation of origin) is a cow's milk cheese produced only on the Asiago plateau in the Veneto foothills in Italy. The cheese-making tradition in the provinces of Vicenza and Trento dates back more than a thousand years. Traditionally, it was made from sheep's milk, but today it is produced from unpasteurised cow's milk.The texture of Asiago DOP differs according to its ageing period. There are two types of Asiago - fresh Asiago (Asiago Pressato) has a smooth texture, while aged Asiago (Asiago d'allevo) has a crumbly texture. Asiago d’allevo is matured for different time periods; Mezzano for 4-6 months, Vecchio for more than ten months and Stravecchio for two years. On the other hand, Asiago Pressato made with whole milk, is matured for a month and sold fresh as a softer, milder cheese.Depending on age, the rind of Asiago cheese can be straw-coloured and elastic to brownish-grey and hard. The paste can be white to dark yellow, with small to medium irregular holes. Based on the ageing, Asiago can be used for grating, melting, and slicing on various salads, sandwiches, soups, pasta, and sauces.",

Nearly 75% of the Asiago cheeses produced are Pressato.Asiago Pressato is a semi-soft cheese with medium-sized holes. It has a thin and elastic crust with a soft, buttery, white-yellowish paste. It tastes sweet, buttery, delicate and tangy. The taste is reminiscent of cream and fresh milk. The cheese goes well with sandwiches and salads as it is easily cut, cubed, sliced or melted.",

This off white coloured cheese with the taste reminiscent of buckwheat grain is still produced in small quantities on the island of Fynbo in Denmark. Pasteurised cow's milk and animal rennet goes into making this cheese, which is then shaped into a 4-pound cylinder and aged for several months. It has a smooth, cream colour pate and a natural golden exterior.A semi-hard cheese, Fynbo is very similar in flavour to Gouda and Monterey Jack cheese. Any recipe that requires the use of Monterey Jack could be replaced with Fynbo. However, Fynbo is very difficult to find outside Denmark such as the United States. Though it is exported, the cheese can be tracked mostly to gourmet cheese shops.Since, Danish cheeses such as Fynbo are mild and creamy in flavour; they are commonly eaten with salads, as slices with sandwiches and added in cooking.",

As with other monasteries cheeses of France, Tamie is washed in brine during maturing period. The flavours of this soft cheese are delicate and balanced with sweet notes of fresh cream, salt and hay. It leaves behind a bit of bitterness on the finish. Tamie is often compared to Reblochon, but its paste is less creamy and has a stronger taste.Abbaye de Tamie is easily recognizable by its blue and white paper packing. It pairs well with Cru Beaujolais, Sangiovese, Chardonnay, Merlot or Beaujolais.",
